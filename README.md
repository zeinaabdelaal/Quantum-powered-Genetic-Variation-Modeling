# Quantum-powered-Genetic-Variation-Modeling

This project leverages the unique capabilities of quantum randomness to simulate allele distributions across a mixed population. Due to the QRNG it generates a accurate, bias free model of the population that better reflects the predictable unpredictability of real life genetic diversity. Thus giving insight to medical proffessionals of the prevalent genetic makeup of the studied population. Developed during the Qiskit Fall Fest 2024 hackathon, it demonstrates how quantum-powered simulations can bring new levels of accuracy and variability to genetic modeling.

### Usefulness
Understanding the genetic makeup of a population is crucial for advancing healthcare. Such insights can be applied to develop targeted medical solutions, vaccines, or treatments tailored to a population's unique genetic profile. By enhancing the way we model genetic diversity, this project offers a glimpse into how quantum technology can contribute to better health outcomes and precision medicine.
